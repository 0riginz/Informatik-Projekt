# Aufgabenstellung

	Development

To develop the project, a lot of tasks have to be completed. Some requirements on how to do that:

*   As you can see below, tasks are organized in blocks. Each block has to be completed before beginning with the next one but within each block you can pick any order that makes sense to you.
*   At the beginning of the project, create one milestone per block.
*   At the beginning of each milestone (at the latest), create one issue per top-level bullet and add it to the correct milestone. Update them by assigning them to you when you start working on them and close them when youâ€™re done. If something's not clear, ask me on the issue.
*   Wherever possible use pull requests to complete a task and please wait with merging them until I give it a thumbs-up.
*   Release a new version after each block:
       * create a Git tag, e.g. v1.0, and push it
       * make a release on GitHub
       * use Maven to build a JAR and upload it to your release
